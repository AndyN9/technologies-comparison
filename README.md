# Technologies Comparison
Comparing related topics is one of the most effective ways **for me to learn**. This repository houses **my notes** as well as application examples of various web technologies, with a focus on micro web frameworks and JavaScript-based user interfaces.

## Application Examples

### 401k Contribution Library
- [JavaScript Version](javascript/401k-contribution)
- [PHP Version](php/401k-contribution)

A library to calculate the 401k contribution amount per paycheck. The main objectives of building this library were to get familiar with the language's package manager, OOP paradigm, and testing framework.

## Programming Languages
